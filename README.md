# Generally, we choose neural network as the principle learning model, and utilize neural network to classify each list of answers from responds after we trained the neural networks. Why we choose to use neural network as our model is because: we are using data set from many lab 3, each responds in this data set are required to answer multiple questions. That means, we cannot use a simple logistic regression or support vector machine to classify each responds into either class: A or B. We are required to design a model which capable of classifying multiple attributes for a single respondents, where neural network (multi layer perceptrons) seems to be a perfect tool
